      <h1>Moved to Linux With a Tragedy

        Moving To Linux is kind of a great experience, when you have been a windows user for years And years it's kind of liberating because you have so much control over the system and you can do pretty much anything you want to do. 

The Best thing about Linux is it’s damn customizable you can almost customize every aspect of it and that’s what makes Linux so damn special.

So, Why I moved to Linux from windows, To be honest, I don’t hate windows in fact I use it occasionally 
For Video editing and photoshop. I dual booted my system with Linux and windows and it’s working fine for me.

When I made the decision to move to Linux, I was like there is so much variety in Linux, it's like different flavors of ice creams, There’s Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, and others. So, I went online and searched the best Linux distro to use, I saw that arch was pretty popular, Arch was all over the internet so, I decided let's go with arch but when I went into how to install arch than I got to know that installing it is a level 2 user job, and I'm just getting started.

Then I got to know that there’s a distro called Manjaro which is based on arch so decided that this is it. let’s go with Manjaro i tried to install it and in the process of installing a tragedy took place and I wiped out my entire hard drive and lost all my data, but in the process, I learned about different partition tables like - MBR, GPT and got to know how they work, and how they are different. and How to install Different Linux Distros. So, this is how I Moved to Linux with a tragedy.
